Request feedback or clarification on a Linear issue.

## Usage

```
/get-feedback-linear
/get-feedback-linear <brief question>
```

## Description

Use this command when you're blocked and need clarification, design input, or decisions from teammates. This command will:
- Post your questions as a comment to the Linear issue
- Update issue status to "Feedback Required" (or equivalent)
- Optionally tag specific people for visibility
- Optionally pause your work until feedback is received

Perfect for:
- Unclear requirements or acceptance criteria
- Architectural or design decisions needed
- Missing information or specifications
- UX/UI clarifications
- Product owner input required
- Technical blocker needing team discussion

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Current Issue

If you're actively working on an issue, Claude detects it from your current branch:
```
Current issue: {{formats.issueExample}} - [Title]
```

If not on a feature branch:
```
Which issue needs feedback?
Issue ID: _____
```

### Step 2: Gather Questions

Claude asks:
```
What questions or clarifications do you need?

Options:
1. I'll type my questions
2. Help me formulate questions based on blockers
```

**Option 1 - You provide questions:**
```
What do you need clarified?

You can provide:
- Single question
- Multiple questions (numbered list)
- Specific areas of confusion
```

**Option 2 - Claude helps formulate:**
Claude analyzes:
- Current task analysis document
- Issue description and acceptance criteria
- Recent comments on the issue
- Your current progress

Then suggests questions like:
```
Based on your work, here are suggested questions:

1. [Acceptance criterion X] - Should this handle edge case Y?
2. [Technical approach] - Should we use library A or B?
3. [Design] - What should happen when user does Z?

Would you like to use these, or modify them?
```

### Step 3: Tag People (Optional)

```
Who should respond to this feedback request?

Options:
1. Issue creator ({{issue.creator.name}})
2. Specific person (enter name/email)
3. Product owner / Tech lead
4. No one specific (team will see it)
```

### Step 4: Pause Work?

```
Would you like to pause work on this issue while waiting? (Y/n)

Yes: Status → "Feedback Required", commit WIP changes
No: Status → "Feedback Required", keep working
```

### Step 5: Post to Linear

Claude posts formatted comment:
```markdown
## Feedback Needed

{{#if taggedPerson}}
@{{taggedPerson}} - Your input is needed on the following:
{{/if}}

**Questions:**

{{#each questions}}
{{@index}}. {{this}}
{{/each}}

**Context:**
{{context}}

**Urgency:** {{urgency}}

**Blocking work:** {{#if pausingWork}}Yes - work paused{{else}}No - continuing with assumptions{{/if}}

{{#if assumptions}}
**Current Assumptions:**
If no feedback received, I'll proceed assuming:
{{#each assumptions}}
- {{this}}
{{/each}}
{{/if}}

### Step 6: Update Status

Claude updates issue status to "Feedback Required" (using status definitions from config):
```
✓ Issue status updated: "Feedback Required"
✓ Comment posted to Linear issue
{{#if taggedPerson}}✓ {{taggedPerson}} tagged for notification{{/if}}
{{#if pausingWork}}✓ Work paused - WIP changes committed{{/if}}
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Quick Question
```
You: "/get-feedback-linear Should this support mobile devices?"

Claude: [Detects current issue from branch]
        "Current issue: {{formats.issueExample}} - Add user profile"

        "Who should respond? 1. Issue creator, 2. Specific person, 3. No one"
You: "1"

Claude: "Pause work while waiting? (Y/n)"
You: "n"

Claude: [Posts comment to Linear]
        [Updates status to "Feedback Required"]
        "✓ Feedback request posted"
        "✓ You can continue working with current assumptions"
```

### Example 2: Multiple Questions
```
You: "/get-feedback-linear"

Claude: "What questions do you need answered?"
        "1. I'll type them, 2. Help me formulate"
You: "1"

Claude: "What do you need clarified?"
You: "1. Should we support CSV and Excel, or just CSV?
     2. What's the max file size?
     3. Should this be a background job or sync?"

Claude: "Who should respond? 1. @alice (creator), 2. Specific, 3. No one"
You: "2"

Claude: "Enter their name or email:"
You: "bob@team.com"

Claude: "Pause work while waiting? (Y/n)"
You: "y"

Claude: [Posts formatted comment with all 3 questions]
        [Tags @bob]
        [Updates status]
        [Commits WIP changes]
        "✓ Feedback request posted and @bob tagged"
        "✓ Work paused - WIP committed to branch"
        "✓ Issue status: Feedback Required"

        "What would you like to do now?"
        "1. Work on another issue"
        "2. Take a break"
        "3. Review other feedback requests"
```

### Example 3: Claude Helps Formulate
```
You: "I'm stuck on this, not sure what to ask"
     "/get-feedback-linear"

Claude: [Analyzes task analysis and progress]

        "Based on your work, I see potential questions:

        1. Acceptance criteria says 'real-time updates' - should we use
           WebSocket or polling? No decision documented.

        2. You're implementing CSV export but acceptance criteria mentions
           'various formats' - which formats are required?

        3. Current implementation allows unlimited rows - should there be
           a limit for performance?

        Would you like to request feedback on these? (Y/n)"
You: "y"

Claude: [Posts all 3 questions to Linear with context]
        "✓ Posted 3 questions to Linear"
        "✓ Issue status: Feedback Required"
```

### Example 4: Urgent Blocker
```
You: "/get-feedback-linear This is blocking me - which API endpoint should I use?"

Claude: "Current issue: {{formats.issueExample}}"
        "Urgency: Blocking"

        "Who should respond ASAP?"
You: "Tech lead"

Claude: "Enter their email:"
You: "techleady@team.com"

Claude: "I'll mark this as urgent. Pause work? (Y/n)"
You: "y"

Claude: [Posts urgent feedback request]
        [Tags tech lead]
        [Updates to Feedback Required]
        [Commits WIP]

        "✓ URGENT feedback request posted"
        "✓ @techlead tagged and will be notified"
        "✓ Work paused"

        "Switching context - show other available work? (Y/n)"
```

## Benefits

- **Clear communication** - Structured questions with context
- **Proper tracking** - Issue status reflects blocking state
- **Notifications** - Tagged people get notified
- **Context preservation** - WIP changes committed safely
- **Visibility** - Team sees what's blocked in Linear
- **Assumptions documented** - If proceeding without feedback

## Configuration

Uses your Linear workflow configuration:

- **Team**: {{linear.teamName}} ({{linear.teamKey}})
- **Feedback Status**: Automatically finds status with meaning "needs feedback" or "blockers"
- **Default**: If no feedback status exists, uses "On Hold"

The command intelligently maps to your workflow:
```javascript
// Find appropriate "feedback required" status
const feedbackStatus = Object.values(config.linear.statuses).find(s =>
  s.meaning?.includes('feedback') ||
  s.meaning?.includes('clarification') ||
  s.meaning?.includes('blockers') ||
  s.name.toLowerCase().includes('feedback')
);
```

## Related Commands

- `/pause-linear` - Pause work without requesting feedback
- `/blocked-linear` - Mark as blocked by external dependency
- `/create-blocker-linear` - Create a blocking issue
- `/progress-update` - Post general progress update

## Tips

1. **Be specific** - "Which API endpoint?" vs "I'm confused"
2. **Provide context** - Explain what you've tried or considered
3. **Tag the right person** - Issue creator, product owner, or tech lead
4. **Document assumptions** - What you'll do if no response
5. **Set urgency** - Is this blocking you completely or just unclear?

## Advanced: Batch Feedback Requests

If working on multiple issues that need feedback:
```
You: "I need feedback on 3 issues"

Claude: "Would you like to request feedback on multiple issues? (Y/n)"
You: "y"

Claude: "List the issue IDs (comma-separated):"
You: "DEV-123, DEV-124, DEV-125"

Claude: [Processes each issue, posts feedback requests]
        "✓ Feedback requested on 3 issues"
        "✓ All marked as 'Feedback Required'"
```
