Create a sub-task for your current Linear issue.

## Usage

```
/create-subtask-linear
/create-subtask-linear <subtask description>
```

## Description

Break down large issues into smaller, trackable sub-tasks. Automatically links to parent issue.

Perfect for:
- Breaking down large features
- Parallel work assignments
- Tracking components of complex work
- Iterative delivery

## Workflow

```
You: "/create-subtask-linear Add login form UI"

Claude: "Creating sub-task for: {{formats.issueExample}} - User authentication"

        "How complex is this sub-task?"
        "1. Small (1-2 hours)"
        "2. Medium (half day)"
        "3. Large (1-2 days) - consider breaking down further"
You: "1"

Claude: "Does this depend on anything?"
        "1. No dependencies - can work on anytime"
        "2. Depends on other sub-tasks"
        "3. Depends on parent issue completion"
        "4. Depends on external factor"
You: "1"

Claude: "Who should work on this?"
        "1. Me"
        "2. Another team member (specify)"
        "3. Unassigned (assign later)"
You: "1"

Claude: [Creates sub-task]
        [Links as child of {{formats.issueExample}}]
        [Sets estimate based on complexity]
        [Assigns to you]

        "✓ Sub-task created: DEV-501 - Add login form UI"
        "✓ Linked to parent: {{formats.issueExample}}"
        "✓ Estimate: 1-2 hours"
        "✓ Assigned to: you"

        "Want to start work on this sub-task now? (Y/n)"
You: "y"

Claude: [Starts work on DEV-501]
