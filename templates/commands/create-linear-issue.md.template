Create a new Linear issue and optionally start work immediately.

## Usage

```
/create-linear-issue
/create-linear-issue <brief description>
```

## Description

This command helps you create Linear issues from the terminal without breaking your flow. Perfect for:
- Quick bug reports discovered during development
- New feature ideas that don't require design docs
- Improvements or tech debt items
- Any work that needs to be tracked in Linear

## Workflow

When you run this command (or when Claude detects you're starting new work):

### Step 1: Confirm Issue Creation
```
Would you like to create a Linear issue for this? (Y/n)
```

### Step 2: Select Template
Claude shows available Linear templates:
```
Which template would you like to use?
1. Bug Report
2. Improvement
3. Feature
4. [Any custom templates in your workspace]
```

### Step 3: Add Context
```
Would you like to add context, or should I draft the issue?

Options:
1. I'll provide context (you describe it)
2. Draft it for me (Claude creates comprehensive description)
```

**Option 1 - You provide context:**
- Claude prompts you for title, description, acceptance criteria
- You control the content
- Best when you have specific requirements

**Option 2 - Claude drafts:**
- Claude analyzes your initial request
- Creates comprehensive description with:
  - Clear overview
  - Detailed requirements
  - Acceptance criteria
  - Technical considerations
- Best for quick issue creation

### Step 4: Issue Created
```
Issue created: {{formats.issueExample}} - [Title]

Linear URL: https://linear.app/{{linear.workspaceName}}/issue/{{formats.issueExample}}
```

### Step 5: Start Work (Optional)
```
Ready to start work on this issue? (Y/n)
```

If you say yes, Claude follows the normal workflow:
1. Fetches issue details from Linear
2. Creates task analysis document in `{{paths.issues}}`
3. Posts analysis summary as Linear comment
4. Creates feature branch
5. Makes initial commit

## Examples

### Example 1: Quick Feature
```
You: "/create-linear-issue Add CSV export to reports"

Claude: "Which template? 1. Bug, 2. Improvement, 3. Feature"
You: "3"

Claude: "Should I draft it? (1. You provide, 2. I'll draft)"
You: "2"

Claude: [Creates {{formats.issueExample}} with full feature description]
        "Ready to start work? (Y/n)"
You: "y"

Claude: [Starts normal workflow - branch, analysis, commit]
```

### Example 2: Bug During Development
```
You: "I found a bug - the login timeout is too short"

Claude: "Would you like to create a Linear issue for this? (Y/n)"
You: "y"

Claude: "Which template? 1. Bug Report, 2. Improvement, 3. Feature"
You: "1"

Claude: "I'll draft the bug report based on your description"
        [Creates {{formats.issueExample}} with bug details]
        "Ready to start work? (Y/n)"
You: "n"

Claude: "Issue created and ready when you are!"
```

### Example 3: Natural Language Detection
```
You: "Let's add user authentication to the dashboard"

Claude: "Would you like to create a Linear issue for this? (Y/n)"
You: "y"

[Follows same flow as above]
```

## Benefits

- **Stay in terminal** - No context switching to Linear web app
- **Quick capture** - Create issues in seconds, not minutes
- **Immediate action** - Optionally start work right after creating issue
- **Team visibility** - All work tracked in Linear automatically
- **Rich context** - Claude-generated descriptions are comprehensive
- **Template consistency** - Uses your team's Linear templates

## Configuration

This command uses your Linear workflow configuration:

- **Team**: {{linear.teamName}} ({{linear.teamKey}})
- **Workspace**: {{linear.workspaceName}}
- **Templates**: Fetched from your Linear workspace
- **Default Status**: Issues created as "To Do"

## Related Commands

- `/start-issue` - Start work on an existing Linear issue
- `/create-pr` - Create pull request with Linear integration
- `/progress-update` - Post progress update to Linear

## Tips

1. **Be descriptive in initial request** - The more context you provide, the better Claude can draft the issue
2. **Use templates** - They ensure consistency and completeness
3. **Start work immediately** - Say "y" to begin working right after creation
4. **Or create for later** - Say "n" if you want to batch work or assign to someone else
