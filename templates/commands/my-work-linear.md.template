## Intelligence Features

### 1. Current Branch Detection

Shows which issue you're actively working on:
```
DEV-458: Optimize queries (In Progress, 5 hours) ← Currently active
Branch: feature/DEV-458-optimize ✓
```

### 2. Staleness Warnings

Flags issues that may need attention:
```
DEV-459: Add dark mode (In Progress, 14 days) ⚠️  Stale
Branch: feature/DEV-459-dark-mode
Last commit: 10 days ago

⚠️  This issue has been in progress for 2 weeks with no commits.
    Consider: Pausing, updating status, or requesting help.
```

### 3. Missing Branches

Identifies issues in progress without branches:
```
DEV-460: Implement search (In Progress, 2 days) ⚠️
Branch: Not found ✗

⚠️  This issue is marked as "In Progress" but has no feature branch.
    Was this auto-updated by accident? Start work or update status.
```

### 4. Smart Grouping

Groups by:
- **Priority** (Urgent, High, Normal, Low)
- **Status** (Active, Paused, Blocked, Review, Done)
- **Time in status** (Recently updated vs stale)

### 5. Quick Actions

Offers contextual actions:
```
What would you like to do?
1. Continue current work (DEV-458)
2. Resume paused work (2 issues)

## Integration with Other Commands

The view provides quick access to other commands:

**From active work:**
- Select issue → Continue work (resumes if paused)

## Configuration

Uses your Linear workflow configuration:

- **Team**: {{linear.teamName}} ({{linear.teamKey}})

  - Active: Statuses with "working", "in progress", "review"
  - Paused: Statuses with "hold", "paused"
  - Blocked: Statuses with "feedback", "blocked", "waiting"

```javascript
// Fetch user's issues
const myIssues = await searchIssues({
  filter: {
    assignee: { id: { eq: currentUser.id } },
    state: { type: { nin: ["completed", "canceled"] } },
    team: { id: { eq: config.linear.teamId } }
  },
  orderBy: { updatedAt: "desc" }
});

// Group by status meaning
const grouped = groupByStatusMeaning(myIssues, config.linear.statuses);
```
