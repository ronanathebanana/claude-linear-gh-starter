## 💡 Pro Tips

**Natural Language Works Too!**

You don't need to memorize these commands. Just talk naturally:

- "Let's get to work on {{formats.issueExample}}"
- "I found a bug - login timeout is too short"
- "What am I working on?"
- "Show me high priority items"
- "Create a blocker for this"
- "Ready for review"

**Quick Examples:**

```bash
# Start your day
/my-work-linear                    # See what you're working on
/high-priority-linear              # Check urgent items
/start-issue {{formats.issueExample}}              # Continue or start work

# Create new work
/bug-linear Login timeout too short
/feature-linear Add dark mode toggle

# When blocked
/feedback-linear Should this support mobile?
/blocked-linear Waiting for API deployment
/create-blocker-linear Database indexes needed

# Deliver work
/create-pr                         # Create pull request
/progress-update                   # Share progress
```
