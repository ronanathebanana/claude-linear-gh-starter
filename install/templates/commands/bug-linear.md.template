Create a bug report in Linear and optionally start work immediately.

## Usage

```
/bug-linear
/bug-linear <brief description>
```

## Description

Quick shortcut for creating bug reports without template selection. This command automatically uses the "Bug Report" template and streamlines the issue creation process.

Perfect for:
- Bugs discovered during development
- Quick bug reports that need tracking
- Issues found during testing or code review

## Workflow

### Step 1: Bug Description

Claude asks:
```
Would you like to add context, or should I draft the bug report?

Options:
1. I'll provide context (you describe the bug)
2. Draft it for me (Claude creates comprehensive bug report)
```

**Option 1 - You provide context:**
Claude prompts you for:
- Title
- Description (what's wrong)
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Environment details

**Option 2 - Claude drafts:**
Claude analyzes your initial request and creates:
```markdown
## Description
[What the bug is]

## Steps to Reproduce
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

## Expected Behavior
[What should happen]

## Actual Behavior
[What actually happens]

## Environment
- Browser/Device: [Detected or inferred]
- Version: [If applicable]

## Additional Context
[Relevant details from your description]
```

### Step 2: Issue Created
```
Bug created: {{formats.issueExample}} - [Title]

Linear URL: https://linear.app/{{linear.workspaceName}}/issue/{{formats.issueExample}}
```

### Step 3: Start Work (Optional)
```
Ready to start fixing this bug? (Y/n)
```

If you say yes, Claude follows the normal workflow:
1. Fetches bug details from Linear
2. Creates task analysis document
3. **Asks for confirmation before posting to Linear:**
   ```
   Task analysis complete!

   Would you like me to post a summary comment to Linear? (Y/n)
   ```
4. **If yes:** Build comment summary from task analysis, then post to Linear
5. **If no:** Skip building and posting entirely, continue with workflow
6. Creates feature branch
7. Makes initial commit

## Examples

### Example 1: Quick Bug Report
```
You: "/bug-linear Login timeout is too short"

Claude: "Should I draft the bug report? (1. You provide, 2. I'll draft)"
You: "2"

Claude: [Creates {{formats.issueExample}} with bug details]
        "Bug created: {{formats.issueExample}} - Login timeout too short"
        "Ready to start fixing this bug? (Y/n)"
You: "y"

Claude: [Starts normal workflow]
```

### Example 2: Detailed Bug with Context
```
You: "/bug-linear"

Claude: "Should I draft it? (1. You provide, 2. I'll draft)"
You: "1"

Claude: "What's the bug title?"
You: "Payment form fails on Safari"

Claude: "Describe what's happening:"
You: "The payment form doesn't submit on Safari. It works on Chrome."

Claude: "Steps to reproduce?"
You: "1. Open payment page on Safari, 2. Fill in card details, 3. Click submit"

Claude: "Expected behavior?"
You: "Payment should process successfully"

Claude: [Creates comprehensive bug report]
        "Bug created: {{formats.issueExample}} - Payment form fails on Safari"
        "Ready to start fixing? (Y/n)"
```

### Example 3: Bug During Development
```
You: "I found a bug - the mobile menu doesn't close after clicking a link"
     "/bug-linear"

Claude: "Should I draft it based on what you just described? (Y/n)"
You: "y"

Claude: [Uses your previous description to create bug report]
        "Bug created: {{formats.issueExample}} - Mobile menu doesn't close"
        "Ready to fix this now? (Y/n)"
You: "n"

Claude: "Bug tracked in Linear. You can fix it later!"
```
