Start work on an existing Linear issue.

Usage:
  /start-issue {{formats.issueExample}}
  /start-issue

If no issue ID provided, you'll be prompted to enter one.

This command will:
1. Fetch issue details from Linear (via MCP)
2. Create comprehensive task analysis document
3. Ask: "Would you like me to post a summary comment to Linear? (Y/n)"
4. If yes: Build comment summary, then post as Linear comment
5. If no: Skip building/posting, continue workflow
6. Create feature branch: feature/{{formats.issueExample}}-description
7. Make initial commit with issue reference
8. Update issue status to "{{linear.statuses.inProgress}}"

Example:
  /start-issue {{formats.issueExample}}

This will analyze the issue, create documentation, optionally post to Linear,
create a branch, and get you ready to start coding.
