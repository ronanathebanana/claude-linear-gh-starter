Create a feature request in Linear and optionally start work immediately.

## Usage

```
/feature-linear
/feature-linear <brief description>
```

## Description

Quick shortcut for creating feature requests without template selection. This command automatically uses the "Feature" template for new functionality.

Perfect for:
- New features and capabilities
- New user-facing functionality
- New API endpoints or integrations
- New pages or workflows
- Significant new additions to the product

## Workflow

### Step 1: Feature Description

Claude asks:
```
Would you like to add context, or should I draft the feature?

Options:
1. I'll provide context (you describe it)
2. Draft it for me (Claude creates comprehensive feature description)
```

**Option 1 - You provide context:**
Claude prompts you for:
- Title
- Feature description (what it does)
- User story (who needs it and why)
- Acceptance criteria (when it's done)
- Technical notes (implementation considerations)
- Design/mockups (if applicable)

**Option 2 - Claude drafts:**
Claude analyzes your request and creates:
```markdown
## Feature Description
[What this feature does and why it matters]

## User Story
As a [user type], I want to [action] so that [benefit].

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Criterion 1]
- [ ] [Criterion 2]
- [ ] [Criterion 3]
- [ ] [Criterion 4]

## Technical Notes
[Implementation approach, architecture considerations, dependencies]

## Design/Mockups
[Placeholder for designs or link to figma]

## Out of Scope
[What this feature does NOT include]
```

### Step 2: Issue Created
```
Feature created: {{formats.issueExample}} - [Title]

Linear URL: https://linear.app/{{linear.workspaceName}}/issue/{{formats.issueExample}}
```

### Step 3: Start Work (Optional)
```
Ready to start building this feature? (Y/n)
```

If you say yes, Claude follows the normal workflow:
1. Fetches feature details from Linear
2. Creates comprehensive task analysis
3. **Asks for confirmation before posting to Linear:**
   ```
   Task analysis complete!

   Would you like me to post a summary comment to Linear? (Y/n)
   ```
4. **If yes:** Build comment summary from task analysis, then post to Linear
5. **If no:** Skip building and posting entirely, continue with workflow
6. Creates feature branch
7. Makes initial commit

## Examples

### Example 1: New User-Facing Feature
```
You: "/feature-linear Add user profile page"

Claude: "Should I draft the feature? (1. You provide, 2. I'll draft)"
You: "2"

Claude: [Creates comprehensive feature with user story and criteria]
        "Feature created: {{formats.issueExample}} - User profile page"
        "Ready to start building? (Y/n)"
You: "y"

Claude: [Starts normal workflow with detailed analysis]
```

### Example 2: API Integration
```
You: "/feature-linear Integrate Stripe payment processing"

Claude: "Should I draft it? (1. You provide, 2. I'll draft)"
You: "1"

Claude: "What's the feature description?"
You: "Add Stripe integration for subscription payments"

Claude: "Who needs this and why (user story)?"
You: "As a customer, I want to subscribe monthly so I can access premium features"

Claude: "What are the acceptance criteria?"
You: "Stripe account connected, subscription plans created, payment flow works, webhooks handle events"

Claude: [Creates detailed feature issue]
        "Feature created: {{formats.issueExample}} - Stripe integration"
        "Ready to start? (Y/n)"
```

### Example 3: Quick Feature Capture
```
You: "We need CSV export for all reports"
     "/feature-linear"

Claude: "Should I draft this feature based on what you just said? (Y/n)"
You: "y"

Claude: [Uses previous context to create feature]
        "Feature created: {{formats.issueExample}} - CSV export for reports"
        "Ready to start building? (Y/n)"
You: "n"

Claude: "Feature tracked! You can implement it when ready."
```

### Example 4: Complex Feature with Planning
```
You: "/feature-linear Build notification system"

Claude: "Should I draft the feature? (1. You provide, 2. I'll draft)"
You: "2"

Claude: [Creates comprehensive feature breakdown]
        "Feature created: {{formats.issueExample}} - Notification system"

        Includes:
        - Email notifications
        - In-app notifications
        - Notification preferences
        - Real-time updates via WebSocket

        "This is a large feature. Should I also create sub-tasks? (Y/n)"
You: "y"

Claude: [Creates 4 sub-tasks for different components]
        "Created 4 sub-tasks. Ready to start with the first one? (Y/n)"
```

## Benefits

- **Fast creation** - Skips template selection
- **Auto-categorized** - Tagged as feature/enhancement
- **Rich planning** - Claude generates comprehensive descriptions
- **User-focused** - Includes user stories and acceptance criteria
- **Immediate action** - Option to start building right away
- **Team alignment** - Clear feature documentation in Linear

## Feature Complexity Detection

Claude can detect feature complexity and offer to break it down:

**Simple Feature** (1-2 days):
- Single component or page
- No external dependencies
- Clear implementation path

**Medium Feature** (3-5 days):
- Multiple components
- Some complexity
- May suggest sub-tasks

**Large Feature** (1+ weeks):
- Multiple systems affected
- External integrations
- Claude proactively suggests breaking into sub-tasks

## Use Cases

### User-Facing Features
- New pages or views
- New user workflows
- Dashboard widgets
- Search and filtering
- User authentication flows

### Backend Features
- New API endpoints
- Database schema changes
- Background job processing
- Caching layer
- Email notifications

### Integrations
- Third-party API integrations (Stripe, Twilio, etc.)
- OAuth providers
- Webhook systems
- External data syncs

### Infrastructure
- Monitoring and logging
- Error tracking integration
- Performance monitoring
- CI/CD improvements

## Configuration

Uses your Linear workflow configuration:
- **Team**: {{linear.teamName}} ({{linear.teamKey}})
- **Template**: Feature (automatic)
- **Default Status**: "To Do"
- **Priority**: Normal (can be changed after creation)

## Related Commands

- `/bug-linear` - Create a bug report
- `/improvement-linear` - Create an improvement issue
- `/create-linear-issue` - Create any type of issue with template selection
- `/start-issue` - Start work on an existing issue

## Tips

1. **Be specific** - "Add dark mode toggle" is better than "Add dark mode"
2. **Think user-first** - Frame features as user benefits
3. **Consider scope** - Large features should be broken into sub-tasks
4. **Document assumptions** - Note any dependencies or prerequisites
5. **Start small** - Better to ship iteratively than all at once
