Create a blocker issue that blocks your current work.

## Usage

```
/create-blocker-linear
/create-blocker-linear <blocker description>
```

## Description

Create a separate Linear issue to track what's blocking you, automatically link it to your current issue.

Perfect for:
- External dependencies that need tracking
- Infrastructure work that must be done first
- Issues discovered that must be fixed before continuing
- API/service dependencies from other teams

## Workflow

```
You: "/create-blocker-linear Database indexes need to be added"

Claude: "Creating blocker issue..."

        "Current issue: {{formats.issueExample}} - User authentication"

        "What type of blocker?"
        "1. Infrastructure (database, servers, etc.)"
        "2. Bug that must be fixed first"
        "3. Dependency from another team"
        "4. Missing feature/API"
You: "1"

Claude: "Who should work on this blocker?"
        "1. Me"
        "2. Another team member (specify)"
        "3. Another team (DevOps, Backend, etc.)"
        "4. Unassigned"
You: "3"

Claude: "Which team?"
You: "DevOps"

Claude: "Priority for this blocker?"
        "1. Urgent (blocking production)"
        "2. High (blocking active sprint work)"
        "3. Normal"
You: "2"

Claude: [Creates blocker issue]
        [Links as "blocks" current issue]
        [Assigns to DevOps]
        [Sets priority]

        "✓ Blocker created: DEV-500 - Add database indexes"
        "✓ Linked: DEV-500 blocks {{formats.issueExample}}"
        "✓ Assigned to: DevOps team"

        "Want to mark {{formats.issueExample}} as blocked? (Y/n)"
You: "y"

Claude: [Updates {{formats.issueExample}} status to blocked]
        "✓ {{formats.issueExample}} marked as blocked"

        "What would you like to do now?"
        "1. Work on another issue"
        "2. Work on the blocker (DEV-500)"
        "3. Show high priority items"
```

## Benefits

- **Separate tracking** - Blocker has its own issue
- **Team visibility** - Other teams see what's blocking
- **Automatic linking** - Relationships preserved
- **Clear ownership** - Blocker assigned to right team
