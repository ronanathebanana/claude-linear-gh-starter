Create an improvement issue in Linear and optionally start work immediately.

## Usage

```
/improvement-linear
/improvement-linear <brief description>
```

## Description

Quick shortcut for creating improvement issues without template selection. This command automatically uses the "Improvement" template for enhancements to existing functionality.

Perfect for:
- Enhancements to existing features
- Performance optimizations
- UX/UI improvements
- Code quality improvements
- Refactoring tasks

## Workflow

### Step 1: Improvement Description

Claude asks:
```
Would you like to add context, or should I draft the improvement?

Options:
1. I'll provide context (you describe it)
2. Draft it for me (Claude creates comprehensive improvement description)
```

**Option 1 - You provide context:**
Claude prompts you for:
- Title
- Current behavior (how it works now)
- Proposed improvement (how it could be better)
- Benefits (why this matters)
- Considerations (potential tradeoffs)

**Option 2 - Claude drafts:**
Claude analyzes your request and creates:
```markdown
## Current Behavior
[How it works now]

## Proposed Improvement
[How it could be better]

## Benefits
- [Benefit 1]
- [Benefit 2]
- [Benefit 3]

## Considerations
- [Tradeoff or consideration 1]
- [Implementation notes]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Criterion 1]
- [ ] [Criterion 2]
- [ ] [Criterion 3]
```

### Step 2: Issue Created
```
Improvement created: {{formats.issueExample}} - [Title]

Linear URL: https://linear.app/{{linear.workspaceName}}/issue/{{formats.issueExample}}
```

### Step 3: Start Work (Optional)
```
Ready to start working on this improvement? (Y/n)
```

If you say yes, Claude follows the normal workflow:
1. Fetches issue details from Linear
2. Creates task analysis document
3. **Asks for confirmation before posting to Linear:**
   ```
   Task analysis complete!

   Would you like me to post a summary comment to Linear? (Y/n)
   ```
4. **If yes:** Build comment summary from task analysis, then post to Linear
5. **If no:** Skip building and posting entirely, continue with workflow
6. Creates feature branch
7. Makes initial commit

## Examples

### Example 1: Performance Optimization
```
You: "/improvement-linear Optimize database queries in reports"

Claude: "Should I draft the improvement? (1. You provide, 2. I'll draft)"
You: "2"

Claude: [Creates comprehensive improvement with current state analysis]
        "Improvement created: {{formats.issueExample}} - Optimize database queries"
        "Ready to start? (Y/n)"
You: "y"

Claude: [Starts normal workflow]
```

### Example 2: UX Enhancement
```
You: "/improvement-linear Make the search more responsive"

Claude: "Should I draft it? (1. You provide, 2. I'll draft)"
You: "1"

Claude: "What's the current behavior?"
You: "Search only triggers on Enter, which feels slow"

Claude: "What's the proposed improvement?"
You: "Add debounced search as user types"

Claude: "What are the benefits?"
You: "Faster user experience, fewer clicks, feels more modern"

Claude: [Creates improvement issue with your details]
        "Improvement created: {{formats.issueExample}} - Responsive search"
        "Ready to start? (Y/n)"
```

### Example 3: Code Quality
```
You: "The authentication code needs refactoring, it's too complex"
     "/improvement-linear"

Claude: "Should I draft this refactoring improvement? (Y/n)"
You: "y"

Claude: [Analyzes and creates tech debt improvement]
        "Improvement created: {{formats.issueExample}} - Refactor auth code"
        "Ready to tackle this now? (Y/n)"
You: "n"

Claude: "Improvement tracked! You can work on it when ready."
```

### Example 4: Quick Capture
```
You: "/improvement-linear Add loading states to all buttons"

Claude: [Auto-drafts based on clear description]
        "Improvement created: {{formats.issueExample}} - Add button loading states"
        "Ready to start? (Y/n)"
You: "y"
```
