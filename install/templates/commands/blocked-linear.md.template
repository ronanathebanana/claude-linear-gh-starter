Mark a Linear issue as blocked by external dependency.

## Usage

```
/blocked-linear
/blocked-linear <blocker description>
```

## Description

Use this command when you're blocked by an external dependency that you can't resolve yourself. Different from `/feedback-linear` (waiting for team clarification) - this is for hard blockers.

Perfect for:
- Waiting for another team's API/service
- Infrastructure not ready (database, environment, etc.)
- Third-party service dependency
- External approval or access needed
- Dependency on another issue to be completed first

## Workflow

### Quick Flow

```
You: "/blocked-linear Waiting for staging database setup"

Claude: "What's blocking you?"
        "1. Another team/service"
        "2. Infrastructure/environment"
        "3. Third-party service"
        "4. Another issue"
        "5. External approval"
You: "2"

Claude: "Who can unblock this?"
You: "DevOps team"

Claude: "When do you expect this to be unblocked?"
        "1. Today, 2. This week, 3. Next week, 4. Unknown"
You: "2"

Claude: [Posts blocker comment to Linear]
        [Updates status to appropriate blocked status]
        [Optionally creates blocker issue]

        "✓ Issue marked as blocked"
        "✓ Blocker documented"
        "What would you like to do now?"
        "1. Work on another issue"
        "2. Create blocker issue to track"
```

## Benefits

- **Clear blocker tracking** - Team sees what's blocked
- **Status accuracy** - Issue status reflects true state
- **Context preserved** - Blocker details documented
- **Work continuity** - Easy to switch to other work
