Pause work on a Linear issue.

## Usage

```
/pause-linear
/pause-linear <reason>
```

## Description

Use this command when you need to pause work on an issue without it being blocked. This is different from `/get-feedback-linear` or `/blocked-linear` - you're simply switching priorities or taking a break.

Perfect for:
- Higher priority work came up
- End of day / end of sprint
- Switching context to another issue
- Taking a break or vacation
- Waiting for non-blocking dependency

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Current Issue

Claude detects issue from your current branch:
```
Current issue: {{formats.issueExample}} - [Title]
Pausing work on this issue...
```

Or if not on a feature branch:
```
Which issue are you pausing?
Issue ID: _____
```

### Step 2: Reason for Pause

Claude asks:
```
Why are you pausing work on this?

Common reasons:
1. Switching priorities (higher priority work)
2. End of day / end of sprint
3. Waiting for dependency (not blocking)
4. Taking break / vacation
5. Other (specify)
```

### Step 3: When Resuming?

```
When do you plan to resume?

Options:
1. Later today
2. Tomorrow
3. Next week
4. After [specific issue/date]
5. Unknown / TBD
```

### Step 4: Save Progress

```
Committing your WIP changes...

Do you want to add notes for when you resume?

Options:
1. Yes - add resume notes
2. No - just commit current state
```

**If adding notes:**
```
What should you remember when resuming?

Examples:
- "Next: Implement error handling"
- "TODO: Test edge cases"
- "Consider refactoring UserService first"
```

### Step 5: Update Status & Commit

Claude:
1. Commits all WIP changes with descriptive message
2. Updates Linear issue status to "On Hold"
3. Posts pause comment to Linear
4. Returns to main branch

```
✓ WIP changes committed
✓ Issue status updated: "On Hold"
✓ Pause comment posted to Linear
✓ Returned to main branch

Your progress is safely saved!
```

## Pause Comment Format

Posted to Linear issue:
```markdown
## Work Paused

**Reason:** {{reason}}

**Expected Resume:** {{resumeTime}}

**Progress:**
- {{summary of commits since last update}}

**Current State:**
- {{files changed}}
- {{work completed}}

## Resume Work Later

To resume a paused issue:
```
You: "Continue {{formats.issueExample}}"
   OR "/start-issue {{formats.issueExample}}"

Claude: [Detects issue is paused]
        "This issue was paused [X hours/days] ago"

        {{#if resumeNotes}}
        "Resume notes: {{resumeNotes}}"
        {{/if}}

        "Ready to resume? (Y/n)"
You: "y"

Claude: [Checks out feature branch]
        [Shows last commit and WIP state]
        [Updates status to In Progress]

        "✓ Resumed work on {{formats.issueExample}}"
        "✓ Last worked on: {{lastCommitTime}}"
        "✓ Branch: {{branchName}}"
```

## Benefits

- **Clean context switching** - Safely pause and switch issues
- **Progress preservation** - WIP always committed with context
- **Resume clarity** - Notes help you pick up where you left off
- **Team visibility** - Everyone sees paused work in Linear
- **Status tracking** - Issue status reflects current state
- **No lost work** - Everything is committed and tracked

## Configuration

Uses your Linear workflow configuration:

- **Team**: {{linear.teamName}} ({{linear.teamKey}})
- **Hold Status**: Automatically finds status with meaning "paused" or "on hold"
- **Default**: If no hold status exists, keeps current status but adds pause comment

```javascript
// Find "On Hold" status
const onHoldStatus = Object.values(config.linear.statuses).find(s =>
  s.meaning?.includes('paused') ||
  s.meaning?.includes('Hold') ||
  s.name.toLowerCase().includes('hold')
);
```

## Related Commands

- `/get-feedback-linear` - Request feedback and pause (for blockers needing input)
- `/blocked-linear` - Mark as blocked (for external blockers)
- `/resume-linear` - Resume paused work (or use "Continue DEV-XXX")
- `/my-work-linear` - Show all your active/paused issues

## Difference from Other Commands

**`/pause-linear`** - Temporary pause, you'll resume later
- Switching priorities
- End of day
- Taking a break
- Non-blocking wait

**`/get-feedback-linear`** - Blocked waiting for input
- Need clarification
- Need decision
- Missing information
- Waiting for specific person's response

**`/blocked-linear`** - Blocked by external dependency
- Waiting for another team
- Waiting for third-party service
- Infrastructure not ready
- Hard blocker you can't resolve

## Tips

1. **Always add resume notes** - Future you will thank present you
2. **Be honest about timeline** - Helps team plan around paused work
3. **Commit clean state** - Try to reach a stable stopping point
4. **Update often** - If pause extends, update the Linear comment
5. **Link related work** - Mention what you're switching to
